  * pg_virtualenv: New program to create throw-away clusters for running
    regression tests.
  * testsuite: unshare needs "--" or else it eats our options.
  * testsuite: Require netcat-openbsd to be installed.
  * testsuite: Move locale generation here from debian/tests/system, also
    generate en_US.utf8 locale; unset LC_ALL.
  * Drop debian/tests, moved to the postgresql-* server packages.
  * testsute 005_PgCommon: Do the ipv4 tests before the ipv6 ones; skip
    the ipv6 for perl <= 5.10 (i.e. on squeeze and lucid).
  * PgCommon.pm, pg_ctlcluster, pg_createcluster, t/030_errors.t: 9.3 renames
    unix_socket_directory to unix_socket_directories.
  * pg_wrapper: Document that PGHOST overrides PGCLUSTER. (Closes: #697291)
  * pg_wrapper: Skip cluster selection if --host is given on the command line.
    (Closes: #637017) While we are at it, improve --port parsing, too.
  * t/010_defaultport_cluster.t: Add test cases for the above pg_wrapper
    changes.
  * t/040_upgrade.t: dup2 psql stderr to suppress warning 'could not change
    directory to "/tmp/pgtest'.
  * postgresql-client-common: Add Depends: netbase for getprotobyname() in
    PgCommon.pm. (Closes: #697377)

  * debian/supported-versions: Read /etc/os-release if present, and fall back
    to lsb-release. Exit with a proper error message if neither is present.
    This gets rid of the (currently undeclared) strict dependency on
    lsb-release. (Closes: #697182)
  * debian/README.Debian: Update versions to 8.4/9.1, as current for Squeeze
    and Wheezy. (Closes: #697239)

  * debian/backport-ppa: Disable xz compression for lucid.
  * debian/backport-ppa: Disable libraries for -9.1/natty as well, built by
    9.2 now.
  * debian/backport-ppa: Ensure that backport PPA versions are always smaller
    than the versions in -updates.
  * pg_wrapper: Always use the latest available client version of "psql"
    instead of the target cluster's. psql is backwards compatible to all major
    versions that we support in any release. Update tests to use "createdb"
    instead of "psql" for --version tests, and add a new test for the psql
    special case to t/020_create_sql_remove.t. (Closes: #639108)
  * debian/postgresql-common.triggers: Also watch for changes in
    /usr/share/hunspell/; pg_updatedicts handles these as well.
    (Closes: #689994)
  * debian/tests/control: Add netcat-openbsd test dependency for the
    next_free_port() tests added below.
  * debian/backport-ppa: Drop natty (EOL), add raring for 9.2.
  * debian/supported-versions: Add Ubuntu 13.04.
  * testsuite: Run with overlaid tmpfses on the postgresql /etc/ and /var
    directories in an unshared namespace. This is more robust against
    protecting existing clusters, always cleans up after itself properly, and
    also speeds up testing.
  * t/031_errors_disk_full.t: Drop check for existence of unshare, as
    ./testsuite now unconditionally requires it.
  * debian/postgresql-common.postinst: Only chown /var/lib/postgresql if it
    does not already have the correct ownership. This avoids failures when the
    directory is NFS mounted. Thanks Hugh Davenport! (Closes: #693958)

  * testsuite: Move 'disk full' tests from 030_errors to new file
    031_errors_disk_full.

    170_extensions.
  * testsuite 005_PgCommon: Add next_free_port tests (using /bin/nc).
  * supported-versions: Make output configurable via $PG_SUPPORTED_VERSIONS,
    ~/.pg_supported_versions, and /etc/postgresql-common/supported_versions.
    (Closes: #646700)
  * supported-versions: Add debian-backports and pgdg sections.
    (Closes: #650680)
  * For bpo and pgdg builds (determined by the version number), create
    /etc/postgresql-common/supported_versions with appropriate content.
  * Replace version string comparisions in perl scripts to use numerical
    operators, so things will continue to work when PostgreSQL 10.0 is
    released.
  * debian/rules: Use sort -n for sorting supported-versions output.
  * debian/rules: Use apt-cache policy instead of apt-cache show to determine
    the "candidate" logrotate version.
  * testsuite 020_create_sql_remove: Fix plperl test to work with 8.2.
  * testsuite 085_pg_ctl.conf: Skip for 8.2.

  * t/030_errors.t: For the "fails on insufficient disk space test", move from
    setting up a loop device to a tmpfs in unshare -m. This is more robust for
    cleaning up after itself, and faster as well.

    empty. Add test case to t/030_errors.t.
  * debian/maintscripts-functions: Only try to remove the tsearch_data

  * t/001_packages.t: Print list of installed versions for information.
  * As debian/supported-versions is also used at build-time, add a
    build-dependency on lsb-release for lsb_release to be available. Also,
    print supported versions from debian/rules for easier debugging.

      they do not exist any more.
    - pg_upgradecluster: In the tablespace test, don't query the "spclocation"
      column, which does not exist any more in 9.2. Just check whether we have

  * Add t/160_alternate_confroot.t: Test creation, operation, upgrading, and

    reproduces LP#835630 and other bugs.
  * PgCommon.pm: If $PG_CLUSTER_CONF_ROOT is set, untaint it.
  * pg_upgradecluster: Don't hardcode /etc/postgresql/, use
    $PgCommon::confroot to respect $PG_CLUSTER_CONF_ROOT. (LP: #835630)
  * pg_upgradecluster: Add --logfile option to specify a custom log file for
    the upgraded cluster. Necessary if you want to run this on
    per-user clusters and can't write into /var/log/postgresql/.
  * pg_ctlcluster: When starting as root for >= 9.1, adjust the OOM killer
    protection to -16, so that the postmaster does not get OOM-killed so
    easily (as it appears to claim all the shared memory). 9.1.1-3 and later
    resets oomadj of child processes to 0, so that the client backends can
    still get OOM-killed. Add tests to t/020_create_sql_remove.t.

  * Add t/170_extensions.t: Check that all shipped extensions install and

  * PgCommon.pm: Make {read,set,disable,replace}_conf_value() accept "key
    value" lines without '=', as this is optional as per upstream
    specification. Add appropriate test cases to t/005_PgCommon.t. Thanks
    to Frederic Junod for the original patch suggestion. (Closes: #618583)
  * PgCommon.pm, cluster_info(): If postgresql.conf defines an external PID
    file, check its existence for determining if a cluster is running, instead
    of poking the port. This is more efficient, and also gives correct results
    for overlapping port numbers. Based on a patch from Jens Wilke, thanks!

    pg_config from the latest available one. Otherwise this falls back to
    libpq-dev's version. This should fix a common confusion for people who
    want to build e. g. 9.0 server-side extensions with a newer (like 9.1
    beta) libpq-dev installed. In debian/postgresql-common.{preinst,postrm}:

  * pg_upgradecluster: Revert to the previous encode()/decode() wrapping in
    the "probin" fixup for cluster upgrades from versions < 9.0. Earlier
    versions' replace() function indeed does work on bytea types, not strings,
    so this broke upgrades to 8.4. (Closes: #627227)
  * pg_upgradecluster: Drop all unversioned configuration option transitions,
    which were still from the 7.4 → 8.0 days. These are obsolete, and
    versions >= 96 only support clusters >= 8.1 anyway. In some cases they
    actively break stuff, like inadvertently setting log_statement=all.

  * Add support for 9.1:

    - cleanpg: Stop 9.1 clusters.
    - t/040_upgrade.t: Don't call createlang for upgrades from 9.0 on, as
      PL/pgsql is enabled there by default.
    - t/050_encodings.t: Update for changed error message for invalid usage of

  * debian/supported-versions: Add Ubuntu 11.04. Drop versions which are newer
    than the ones supported in the released versions, as backports are now
    generally accepted by our .config scripts, but having those newer versions
    confuses pg_buildext.
  * debian/postgresql-common.config: Silence warning from --compare-versions
    when being called through a trigger and $2 is not a version number.
    This works around the underlying dpkg problem. (Closes: #608522)
  * Add debian/postgresql-common.sysctl: sysctl.d/ template for changing
    kernel.shmmax and kernel.shmall, which is very common with PostgreSQL.

    avoid using the rather broken libedit. We need to build the postgresql-X.Y
    packages against libedit for license reasons (#603599), but as libreadline
    has a drop-in compatible ABI, this works around the licensing
    restrictions. Thanks to Andreas Barth for working this out! Add a

  * debian/supported-versions: Split testing/squeeze and unstable cases. 9.0
    is not officially supported in Squeeze and testing, it's only available as
    a backport. This will make the "obsolete version installed" debconf note

  * pg_ctlcluster: Also pass additional pg_ctl arguments in "stop" and
    "reload" mode.
  * pg_ctlcluster: Pass correct exit code from pg_ctl in case of errors.
  * PgCommon.pm, get_db_encoding(): Fix uninitialized variable if psql fails.
  * t/040_upgrade.t: Check that pg_upgradecluster exits early and gracefully
    if the old cluster does not stop (usually because there are still active
    connections to it). This reproduces #509050.
  * pg_upgradecluster: Move stopping of old cluster and disabling connections
    to it much ealier, and properly fail without starting the upgrade.
    (Closes: #509050)
  * debian/postgresql-common.preinst: Remove obsolete init script from
    postgresql-8.3 for upgrades from Lenny. It provides "postgresql" which is
    also provided by our common init script, and insserv chokes on this. Our
    common init script handles 8.3 as well and will just take over. Note that
    this is a policy violation, but we can't clean up in -8.3 since that does
    not exist any more in Squeeze. (Closes: #591924)

  * t/030_errors.t: Check that pg_createcluster leaves the original one intact
    if the cluster already exists, also when the original one is not running.
    This reproduces #597097.
  * pg_createcluster: Be more careful with cleaning up the created cluster if
    an error occurs: Do not start the cleanup until we actually passed our
    sanity checks and created files for the new cluster. Before, it would
    erroneously remove an already existing cluster on a sanity check fail, if
    that cluster happened to not be running at the time. (Closes: #597097)
  * debian/supported-versions: Be more robust against lsb_release failing, e.
    g. in the case where it is not fully configured yet. (Closes: #597561)
  * debian/supported-versions: Drop check for /etc/debian_version if
    lsb_release is not working/existing. Derivatives have debian_version as
    well, and we don't actually evaluate it, so just print a meaningful error
    message and go with the default versions.
  * debian/rules: Put init script priority back to S19/K21 to match the
    previous postgresql-8.4 init script. Fix the priorities on upgrade in

  * Migrate to a common init script for all server versions, to avoid
    providing the "postgresql" service in multiple packages (which causes
    insserv to complain bitterly):
    - debian/init.d-functions: Add function get_versions() which returns all
      installed versions, but filters out the ones which have their own init
      script. With that, we can run newer common versions with older server
      packages.
    - debian/maintscripts-functions: Add function stop_version() (to be called
      from "prerm upgrade"), and start cluster in configure_version() if there
      is no version specific init script.
    - Add debian/postgresql-common.postgresql.init: Common init script for all
      installed server versions.
    - debian/rules: Install common init script.

    - pg_upgradecluster: Migrate obsolete/changed configuration parameters.
  * pg_wrapper: Fix spelling.
  * In maintainer scripts, instead of "#!/bin/sh -e" use a separate "set -e",
    per lintian.
  * debian/control: Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.4; no changes necessary.

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * cleanpg: Do not remove the /var/log/postgresql/ directory itself, only its
    contents, to avoid logcheck falling over.
  * t/020_create_sql_remove.t: Do not consider $PG_GRANDPARENT_PID an unsafe
    environment, it's set by 9.0 servers.
  * t/060_obsolete_confparams.t: Add a full configuration for 8.4, so that
    upgrades to 9.0 can be tested.
  * t/052_upgrade_encodings.t: Specify 'C' locale when creating the ASCII
    encoded test database for versions >= 8.4, otherwise we have a
    locale/encoding mismatch.
  * t/TestLib.pm: Abort tests on FAILURE=shell and the shell exits with
    nonzero. This avoids endless followup error shells once it's clear that
    the following ones are doomed anyway.
  * PgCommon.pm: Add new function get_db_locales() which reads lc_ctype and
    lc_locales for a particular database. This replaces the
    get_cluster_locales() function for >= 8.4 server versions (which moved
    from global to per-database locales).
  * pg_upgradecluster: Use get_db_locales() instead of get_cluster_locales()
    for upgrades from >= 8.4.
  * pg_ctlcluster: Drop check for valid locales. We can only determine them
    (using pg_controldata through get_cluster_locales()) for <= 8.3 clusters,
    which are obsolete in sid/lenny. For >= 8.4 clusters, we need to start the
    server to find out the locales, at which point the check is pointless.
  * pg_upgradecluster: Run pg_restore with --disable-triggers when running in
    --data-only mode. (Closes: #579768)
  * t/020_create_sql_remove.t: We now assume that /var/log/postgresql/ always
    exists, and is writable by the "postgres" user. Thus if we delete the log,
    running "pg_ctlcluster start" should be able to recreate it. This fixes
    the 020_create_sql_remove.t test failure in "umask 077" mode, and uncovers
    some more inconsistencies wrt. log directory permissions.
  * pg_createcluster, testsuite: Fix permissions of /var/log/postgresql/ if
    this script creates it.

    exists. If we remove it entirely, current versions of logcheck complain
    loudly. This was already fixed a while ago in squeeze, this will ensure it
    stays so. (Closes: #576180)
  * t/040_upgrade.t: Check upgrade of database and table ACL, an ALTER

  * pg_upgradecluster: Rework logic to use "pg_dumpall -s" instead of
    "pg_dumpall -g", to also catch ACLs, global settings, and the like. Drop
    manual database creation and encoding special-cases, since those are being
    taken care of by the -s commands already. (Closes: #543506, #562676)
  * pg_upgradecluster: Re-enable connections after the upgrade is done, not in

      encoding. Just check psql -Atl.
  * pg_upgradecluster: Don't call createdb/dropdb with -q; it got dropped in
    8.4 and is not necessary any more with 8.3 either.

    Thanks to Cyril Bouthors for pointing this out!
  * t/001_packages.t: Check that postgres user is in the ssl-cert group.
    Thanks to Cyril Bouthors for the patch!
  * Added support for passing additional options to pg_ctl through a new
    configuration file pg_ctl.conf, or as additional CLI arguments to
    pg_ctlcluster. Add tests in t/085_pg_ctl.conf.t. Thanks to Cyril Bouthors

  * debian/README.Debian: Fix "confident" typo. (Closes: #512648)
  * Drop pg_autovacuum handling, which was only necessary for 7.4 (8.0

    allow Etch backports. This also gets rid of pg_maintenance and
    /etc/cron.d/postgresql-common. (Closes: #425914, #481025)
  * Add debian/postgresql-common.preinst: Remove obsolete conffiles

    workarounds for those. Add Conflicts: to postgresql-{7.4,8.0}, to
    ensure that this version isn't used with ancient servers any more.
  * t/030_errors.t: Check that clusters on the same port can run side
    by side if they are using different Unix socket directories and
    different TCP addresses. This reproduces #514132.
  * pg_ctlcluster: Replace overly harsh port conflict check (which
    broke clusters on the same port, but different Unix/TCP
    namespaces) with a more modest one which just checks conflict on
    the same Unix socket directory. Thanks to Bernd Helmle for the
    patch! (Closes: #514132, #472627)

  * Add t/051_inconsistent_encoding_upgrade.t: Check that upgrades from
    pre-8.3 to 8.3 succeed and have correct encodings if the old DB had a
    database whose encoding did not match the server locale. This reproduces
    #472930.
  * pg_upgradecluster: Fix handling of database encodings on upgrade, since
    8.3 now forces DB encodings and server locale to match:
    - With C locale, keep encoding of DBs on upgrade, just as in previous
      versions. (C is compatible with all encodings, and causes lots of string
      functions not to work correctly, but people still use it deliberately.)
    - With other  locales, create the target DB manually with a compatible
      encoding, and call pg_restore in a way to not create the target DB and
      automatically convert encoding.

    not fall over if e. g. /usr/local/bin is misconfigured to be world
    writable. Closes: #420565
  * pg_wrapper: Make this script work with taint checks enabled. This happens
    in a pretty blunt way, since it does not actually make sense to enforce
    environment variables, etc. It should just not fail when being called from
    a -T perl script. Closes: #422129

    script on restart.
  * debian/postgresql-common.config, debian/postgresql-common.templates:

    "untransitioned" test.
  * debian/control: Move cdbs and debhelper from B-D-I to B-D, since we need
    them for 'clean'.
  * Add debian/postgresql-client-common.lintian: Lintian overrides for 'binary
    without manpage'. The stuff in /usr/bin is just a symlink to pg_wrapper,
    postgresql-client-* ships the actual manpages for those.

  * Urgency high since this version only fixes a very important bug with a
    safe patch.
  * Moved package development to bazaar-ng, updated debian/README.Devel.
  * debian/postgresql-common.postinst: Revert change of version 26: Do create
    the socket directory in the postinst, otherwise clusters will default to
    socket directory /tmp in some cases.

postgresql-common (27) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed my debuild alias to explicitly ignore .arch-ids directories (a
    mere -i catched some, but not all arch directories). Closes: #328204
  * Add lintian overrides for missing manpages; manpages are provided by
    postgresql-client-X.Y packages.
  * pg_ctlcluster: Have autovac-* commands error out with a meaningful message
    instead of claiming success if pg_autovacuum is not available.
  * pg_ctlcluster:
    - Increase the timeout for the started postmaster to 30 seconds to cope
      with slow startup. Closes: #320444
    - Immediately fail if the postmaster produced log output and does not run
      any more. This avoids unnecessary timeouts on configuration errors and
      the like.
  * pg_createcluster: Listen on localhost by default only since upstream
    considers listening on all interfaces by default not safe enough.

  * Fix permissions of socket directory:
    - debian/postgresql-common.postinst: Drop creation of socket directory
      since we do it in the init script anyway.
    - debian/init.d-functions: Create directory with permissions 2775 instead
      of 755 and also correct the permissions of an already existing
      directory.
    - Closes: #326049
  * debian/postgresql-common.postinst: Remove --no-create-home option from
    adduser call to ensure that the postgres user always has a sensible home
    directory that does not break "su - postgres".
  * pg_wrapper: Give a meaningful error message if no client packages are
    installed, instead of "Invalid PostgreSQL cluster version".
    Closes: #326771

  * PgCommon.pm, get_cluster_socketdir():
    - If the socket directory is configured in postgresql.conf, use it right
      away instead of doing experiments before.
    - Improved sanity checking.
    - Error out if the data directory cannot be stat'ed, since we cannot
      determine a sensible directory in this case.
  * pg_upgradecluster: Don't call cluster_info() on the yet nonexistant
    new cluster, just check for the data directory for determining if the new
    cluster already exists.
  * debian/control: Add adduser dependency.
  * testsuite: Generalize stopping of servers to work with all versions.
  * Avoid whinging during log rotation if there is no log file at all:
    - debian/postgresql-common.logrotate: Add "missingok".
    - debian/postgresql-common.dirs: Create /var/log/postgresql/.
    - Server packges have been changed to not clean away /var/log/postgresql/
      on purge.
    - Closes: #325330
  * pg_ctlcluster: When starting the autovacuum daemon, don't just wait for 1
    second, but actually test if the server is running  (timeout: 5 seconds);
    this should make the daemon startup much more reliable.
  * Remove test upgrade script upgrade-scripts/all_test_t1.sql, it has done
    its purpose now.

  * debian/postgresql-common.postinst: Call pg_checksystem. Closes: #318928
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.6.2.
  * debian/postgresql-common.postinst: Setup user 'postgres' with /bin/bash as
    default shell. Closes: #320810
  * pg_wrapper, debian/postgresql-common.links: Wrap reindexdb, it is a
    standard client program in 8.1.
  * pg_createcluster: Do not create autovacuum log file for servers >= 8.1.
  * PgCommon.pm: For determining avac_enable on 8.1+ servers, read
    "autovacuum" setting from postgresql.conf.
  * pg_maintenance: Use avac_enable flag instead of checking for the
    pg_autovacuum pid file to determine whether autovacuuming is enabled. This
    is a more general approach and works for all server versions.
  * pg_ctlcluster: Do not attempt to start pg_autovacuum on 8.1+ servers.
  * pg_createcluster: Add hook for version specific function to configure
    postgresql.conf.
  * pg_createcluster: Add default configuration for 7.4 clusters:
    - tcpip_socket = true
    - stats_row_level = true
  * pg_createcluster: Add default configuration for 8.0 clusters:
    - listen_addresses = '*'
    - stats_row_level = true
  * pg_createcluster: Add default configuration for 8.1 clusters:
    - listen_addresses = '*'
    - stats_row_level = on
    - autovacuum = on
  * PgCommon.pm, set_conf_value(): Preserve comments.
  * debian/postgresql-common.postinst: Generalized restarting of all clusters
    to make it automatically work for future versions.
  * pg_createcluster: Adapt pg_hba.conf to the current default (md5 for host
    connections, ident sameuser for local ones); this obsoletes the
    default-pg_hba.conf patches in the server packages.
  * user_clusters: Update comments, throw out bogus documentation.
    Closes: #324749
  * pg_createcluster: Only mangle configuration files (pg_hba.conf, SSL
    enabling, etc.) if we create a new cluster, not if we integrate an already
    existing one. Closes: #323878
  * Add debian/postgresql-common.logrotate: Simple log rotation.

  * Drop upgrade-scripts/all_vacuum_t1.sql since it causes too much trouble
    with big databases. Replace it with upgrade-scripts/all_test_t1.sql which
    just counts the tables in the database. This should be unintrusive, fast,
    and still appropriate for testing the upgrade scripts mechanism.

postgresql-common (20) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add infrastructure for executing SQL or executable scripts on clusters and
    databases on upgrade. This can be useful to apply security updates which
    need to change database layouts (like for CAN-2005-1409), do checks on
    upgrades, and maybe other things.
    - Add run-upgrade-scripts and call it in the postinst.
    - Add /usr/share/postgresql-common/upgrade-scripts/ where scripts are
      stored into.
    - Add /usr/share/postgresql-common/upgrade-scripts/SPECIFICATION.
    - This checks for available databases, thus will not fail on a nonexisting
      template0. Closes: #312707
    - Tests are run right after starting all clusters. Also, the package
      installation does not fail if the upgrade fails on a single cluster or
      database. Closes: #308685
  * pg_ctlcluster: pg_ctl's -o option is not cumulative, fix postmaster
    argument passing. This ensures that "-c unix_socket_directory" is always
    passed to the postmaster.
  * pg_createcluster: Do not configure a cluster for SSL if the owner is not
    the owner of /etc/postgresql-common/postgresql.pem. This fixes cluster
    creation for non-postgres owners.
  * Add test 130_nonpostgres_clusters: Check cluster creation and operation
    for a cluster owned by "nobody".
  * Add upgrade-scripts/all_vacuum_t1.sql: Upgrade script that will just
    vacuum all available databases. This is pretty useful and harmless, and is
    a good thing to test upgrade scripts at a larger scale.
  * init.d-functions: Rename autovac-* to autovac_* to comply to POSIX shell
    identifier rules. Closes: #315551

    the configuration.
  * debian/postgresql-common.postinst: Only restart servers when configuring.
  * debian/init.d-functions: "pg_ctl restart" does not seem to re-read certain
    configuration parameters like the socket directory, so replace it with
    stop+start.
  * debian/postgresql-common.postinst: Create /var/run/postgresql before
    creating the initial cluster to ensure that the socket directory will be
    present. Closes: #312899
  * Added debian/postgresql-common.postrm: Clean up on purge.
  * debian/postgresql-common.postinst: Check whether the user postgres exists

    locally. Closes: #314292
  * testsuite: Ignore whitespace changes in expected vs. actual output.

    - log_{pid,timestamp,hostname,source_port} -> log_line_prefix
    - obsolete max_expr_depth

  * Add test 120_obsolete_confparams: Upgrade a 7.4 cluster with all
    possible 7.4 options enabled.
  * PgCommon.pm: Fix parsing of autovacuum parameters.
  * pg_ctlcluster: Respect the avac_debug autovacuum configuration option.
  * pg_createcluster: Since the new default socket directory is
    /var/run/postgresql, explicitly set /tmp as socket directory for clusters
    if /var/run/postgresql is not writable by the cluster owner.

    upgrades. Closes: #277700, #282803, #224047, #229240, #232553, #279184,
    #241337, #247261, #157282, #167864, #305347
  * pg_wrapper now has a central role for mapping clients to clusters, so it
    is not "overkill" any more. Closes: #201702
