# print a list of PostgreSQL versions that are supported for the platform this
# script runs on.
# Note: Newer installed versions than the highest one listed here are always
# considered supported, so that backports will not cause an "obsolete" warning.
#
# /usr/share/postgresql-common/supported-versions decides which PostgreSQL
# server versions are supported. This information is used
# 1) for notifying users of obsolete versions, suggesting to upgrade, and
# 2) by the pg_buildext tool to decide which server versions to build extension
#    modules for.
#
# The environment variable PG_SUPPORTED_VERSIONS, and the files
# ~/.pg_supported_versions and /etc/postgresql-common/supported_versions (in
# that order) can be used to override the defaults. (Tokens separated by
# newlines.)
#
# Recognized tokens:
# default: use the appropiate defaults for the current distribution and release
#          (as determined by os-release or lsb_release)
# debian [release]: use Debian defaults
# debian-backports [release]: use Debian Backports defaults
# ubuntu [release]: use Ubuntu defaults
# pgdg [release]: use defaults for apt.postgresql.org
# installed: consider all installed versions supported (determined by
#            postgresql-server-dev-X.Y packages)
# X.Y: consider this version supported
