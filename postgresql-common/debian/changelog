    the default port.
  * pg_wrapper: Print proper error message if no cluster is suitable as
    default target and point to man pg_wrapper.
  * pg_upgradecluster:
    - Support /etc/postgresql-common/pg_upgradecluster.d/ hook scripts. These
      are called after creating the virgin new version cluster (phase 'init')
      and a second time after the upgrade is complete (phase 'finish').
      PostgreSQL extensions like PostGIS can use these hooks to initialize
      metadata which must not be upgraded from the old cluster, but
      initialized from scratch. Closes: #351571
    - Document this feature in the manpage POD.
    - If upgrade scripts are present, call pg_restore with the new -X
      no-data-for-failed-tables option to not clutter already existing tables
      in the new cluster with data from the old cluster. Abort with an error
      if the installed pg_restore does not support this option.

      /etc/postgresql-common/pg_upgradecluster.d/.

    hooks and proper pg_restore -X no-data-for-failed-tables behaviour.

  * pg_checksystem, pg_createcluster, pg_dropcluster, pg_upgradecluster: Check
    that effective user is root before doing anything to avoid confusing error
    messages.
  * pg_ctlcluster: Enhance the check if cluster is up and running to make it
    more reliable. This should fix the 'Database system is starting up' errors

    - Improved sanity checking.
    - Error out if the data directory cannot be stat'ed, since we cannot
      determine a sensible directory in this case.
  * pg_upgradecluster: Don't call cluster_info() on the yet nonexistant
    new cluster, just check for the data directory for determining if the new
    cluster already exists.
  * debian/control: Add adduser dependency.
  * testsuite: Generalize stopping of servers to work with all versions.
  * Avoid whinging during log rotation if there is no log file at all:
    - debian/postgresql-common.logrotate: Add "missingok".

  * pg_ctlcluster: When starting the autovacuum daemon, don't just wait for 1
    second, but actually test if the server is running  (timeout: 5 seconds);
    this should make the daemon startup much more reliable.
  * Remove test upgrade script upgrade-scripts/all_test_t1.sql, it has done

    is a more general approach and works for all server versions.
  * pg_ctlcluster: Do not attempt to start pg_autovacuum on 8.1+ servers.

    need to change database layouts (like for CAN-2005-1409), do checks on
    upgrades, and maybe other things.
    - Add run-upgrade-scripts and call it in the postinst.
    - Add /usr/share/postgresql-common/upgrade-scripts/ where scripts are
      stored into.
    - Add /usr/share/postgresql-common/upgrade-scripts/SPECIFICATION.
    - This checks for available databases, thus will not fail on a nonexisting
      template0. Closes: #312707
    - Tests are run right after starting all clusters. Also, the package
      installation does not fail if the upgrade fails on a single cluster or
      database. Closes: #308685
  * pg_ctlcluster: pg_ctl's -o option is not cumulative, fix postmaster
    argument passing. This ensures that "-c unix_socket_directory" is always
    passed to the postmaster.
  * pg_createcluster: Do not configure a cluster for SSL if the owner is not
    the owner of /etc/postgresql-common/postgresql.pem. This fixes cluster
    creation for non-postgres owners.
  * Add test 130_nonpostgres_clusters: Check cluster creation and operation
    for a cluster owned by "nobody".
  * Add upgrade-scripts/all_vacuum_t1.sql: Upgrade script that will just
    vacuum all available databases. This is pretty useful and harmless, and is

    really useful.
  * PgCommon: Fix cluster_info for avac_logfile to make pg_dropcluster clean
    away the autovacuum log file.
  * pg_maintenance: -v only influences vacuumdb output now, always show
    clusters.
  * Added a test suite:
    - Test scripts are in tests/*.
    - Expected output is in tests/*.ex.
    - Test suite is run with './testsuite' as root.
  * pg_createcluster:
    - Converted optional third parameter to option --datadir.
    - Rework POD to have a separate OPTIONS section.
    - Add option description to online help.
  * pg_ctlcluster: Improve POD.
  * pg_upgradecluster:
    - Initial framework for handling obsolete configuration parameters.
    - Handle transition of {tcpip_socket, virtual_host} -> listen_addresses.
  * debian/init.d-functions: If /lib/lsb/init-functions is available, use LSB
    init script functions.
  * pg_ctlcluster: After start, check whether the cluster is really running.
    If it does not come up after 5 seconds, fail and print the recent log
    portion.

postgresql-common (11) experimental; urgency=low

  * pg_ctlcluster: Cleaned up variables.
  * Factored out change_ugid() to PgCommon.pm and use it in the scripts.
  * Added pg_maintenance(8) program.
  * Activated formerly disabled postgresql-common.cron.d which calls
    pg_maintenance.
  * pg_createcluster: Default to cluster owner 'postgres' if no owner is
    specified.
  * pg_ctlcluster: Fix pg_controldata output parsing and call pg_controldata
    under locale 'C' to work with all locales. Closes: #310716
  * pg_createcluster: Added --socket-dir option.
  * PgCommon.pm: Fix declaration of @lines in set_conf_value() to avoid
    duplicating the lines in configuration files.
  * PgCommon.pm: Converted to use strict to avoid future errors.
  * pg_maintenance: Removed option '-e' from vacuumdb call (leftover from
    debugging).
  * PgCommon.pm, user_cluster_map(): If several clusters exist, but no
    mapping is configured, return not only the default port's cluster version,
    but also its name. This fixes the socket directory determination for this
    case.
  * debian/rules: Fix clean target to remove the manpages created from POD
    again.
  * pg_upgradecluster: Provide socket directory arguments to psql and
    pg_dumpall to make it work for sockets which are not in /tmp.

postgresql-common (10) experimental; urgency=low

  * pg_ctlcluster: Supply cluster socket directory to pg_autovacuum.

 -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>  Tue, 24 May 2005 22:57:33 +0200

postgresql-common (9) experimental; urgency=low

  * Add README.Debian with some general introduction, "first steps for the
    impatient", and pointers to further documentation.
  * pg_ctlcluster: Check validity of postmaster locale before setting it.
  * pg_createcluster: Check validity of locale before calling initdb under it.
  * pg_wrapper: Support PGCLUSTER environment variable. Closes: #305912
  * pg_upgradecluster:
    - Copy original configuration files.
    - Configure the target cluster to use the original port, move the old
      cluster to a previously unused port.
    - Start the new cluster after upgrade.
  * debian/init.d-functions: Create /var/run/postgresql if it does not exist.
  * pg_createcluster: Set the socket directory to /var/run/postgresql for
    postgres-owned clusters. Print a warning to change the directory for other
    owners. Closes: #308597
  * pg_wrapper: If PGHOST is not defined, set it to the cluster's socket
    directory to make client programs work with non-default socket
    directories.

postgresql-common (8) experimental; urgency=low

  * pg_ctlcluster: Check whether owner is in the shadow group, and keep shadow
    group privilege in this case; this is a poor workaround for Perl's lack of
    an initgroups() functions. Closes: #305427
  * debian/postgresql-common.postinst: Fix adduser invocation, set home
    directory to /var/lib/postgresql. Closes: #308589
  * Remove pg_default.1 and pg_exec.1, these programs do not exist.  Closes:
    #305724
  * debian/postgresql-common.links: Add a symlink postgresql-common(7) to
    pg_wrapper(1) to make finding the manpage a bit more obvious.
  * PgCommon.pm, user_cluster_map(): If there are no clusters, use the latest
    version; this makes it possible to use remote clusters with no local ones.
    Closes: #306836

postgresql-common (7) experimental; urgency=low

  * Fix warning when calling pg_wrapper with an invalid cluster.
  * PgCommon.pm, user_cluster_map(): If only one cluster exists, return that
    if no match is found in the map files.
  * pg_ctlcluster: Start the postmaster under the locale that was used with
    initdb.
  * Updated documentation in architecture.html.

 -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>  Wed, 20 Apr 2005 02:34:19 +0200

postgresql-common (6) experimental; urgency=low

  * pg_dropcluster: Check if postmaster and autovacuum log file paths are
    defined before unlinking them to avoid a warning. Closes: #303259
  * pg_ctlcluster: Documented the autovacuum stuff in the POD.
  * debian/init.d-functions: Add autovacuum commands.
  * debian/maintscripts-functions: (Re)start/stop autovacuum daemons on
    configuration/removal of p-contrib-*.

    (based on some patches from Adam R. Skutt, thanks).
  * pg_createcluster: Create autovacuum_log symlink and log file.
  * pg_dropcluster: Remove autovacuum_log symlink and log file.
  * PgCommon.pm: If a configuration file is not found in the cluster conf dir,
    fall back to the one in /etc/postgresql-common.
  * Install /etc/postgresql-common/autovacuum.conf as a fallback default
    configuration file for pg_autovacuum.

 -- Martin Pitt <mpitt@debian.org>  Sun,  3 Apr 2005 09:10:27 +0200

postgresql-common (4) experimental; urgency=low

  * pg_upgradecluster: Uncomment library search path (artifact from
    debugging).
  * debian/postgresql-common.postinst: Don't create postgres user with home /,
    this can lead to problems sometimes.
  * pg_ctlcluster: Fixed pg_ctl invocation (dangling -o argument with versions
    < 8.0, caused errors when using dash as /bin/sh). Closes: #300896

postgresql-common (3) experimental; urgency=low

  * Add richer set of common maintainer scripts functions (for package
    removal, and also for client and contrib packages).
  * Use alternatives system to link manpages from
    /usr/share/postgresql/<version>/man/... to /usr/share/man.

  * New package to provide a common infrastructure for different PostgreSQL
    versions. This finally fixes all bugs concerning failed automatic
    upgrades. Closes: #277700, #282803, #224047, #229240, #232553, #279184,
    #241337, #247261, #157282, #167864, #305347
  * pg_wrapper now has a central role for mapping clients to clusters, so it
    is not "overkill" any more. Closes: #201702
