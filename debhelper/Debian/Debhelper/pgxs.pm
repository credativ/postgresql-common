=head1 package_pattern()

From C<debian/control.in>, look for the package name containing the
B<PGVERSION> placeholder, and return it in the format suitable for passing to
B<pg_buildext>, i.e. with B<PGVERSION> replaced by B<%v>.

For B<Package: postgresql-PGVERSION-unit> it will return B<postgresql-%v-unit>.

Errors out if more than one package with the B<PGVERSION> placeholder is found.
